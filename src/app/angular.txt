1. To create an angular project  --- ng new project-name
2. To run an Angular project    --- ng serve / ng s
3. To geneRate a component     --- ng g c component-name
4. To geneRate services       --- ng g s  service-folder/services-name







         basic concept in Angular
____________________________________________


1. Modules : ->  To import Third party libraries, also used to hold component
2. Component : -> Basic building blocks of angular html,css, ts ,and also have salector
3. Selector : -> To replace selector tag with its html page.
4. Decorators (@) : -> To hold meta data (one data to include another data is known as meta data)

   To view a component in another page  ----*


                      *set up a path for component -- app-routing-Module 
                      *router-outlet -- To navigate according to the user request page


 6.Data binding  : -> A data share with in a component. They are 2 types 
                      1.OneWay binding : Data communication between 'ts' to 'html' or 'html' to 'ts' data sharing in one direction [ts => (typeScript): Component],[html => : view]
                       i) ts to html |
                                     V 
                              a)  String interpolation
                                  syntax : {{class property-name}}
                              b)  Property binding 
                                  syntax : [attribute-name]="property"

                                
                       ii) html to ts  |
                                       V   
                              a)  event binding
                                 syntax:
                                          (event-name)="function call"
                                        eg :   (click)="login()"

                              b) event binding using $ event          
                                           (event-name)="function name $(event)"

                              c) using templates reference variable (using '#') 
                                       
                                      syntax :   
                                                 #variable-name

                        

                      2.TwoWay binding :     Data sharing in both direction             

                               a) ngModel   -- import formModule in appModule
                                  syntax :
                                               [(ngModel)]="class property"

                                     .)[(ngModel)]="class property" is used to the form tag after using "name" attribute  

                                   i)Angular Forms  (2 types)
                                      1.)template driven Forms : html page then it is known as template driven forms
                                      2.)model driven forms    : it has a view we can write ts then we create html page  i.e known as model driven
                          

                      7.navigateByUrl: used to redirect one page to another page.It is visible in 'router-class'
                      8.dependency injuction : to share data between depedent classes
                        
                        1:) constructor
                        sytax:
                         constructor(access-spacifier variable-name:class-name){


                         }

                         * variable : depedent class variable
                        
                  9. angular services
                  10. angular directives:DOM Manipulation
                     i) Component directives (view)
                     ii)structural directives : to add or remove  html item (*ngFor="let variable-name of array-name")
                     iii)attribute directives: to apply style to html elements (ngClass---) 

                  11. parent-child  data sharing

                       -)child to parent communication
            
                       -)parent to child communication
